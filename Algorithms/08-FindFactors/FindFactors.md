## Find factors

### Problem

Given a positive integer, return all the smallest factors that would result in the given integer.

Assume an array of all possible primes would be provided.

**Example:**

```
Given num = 64,
Because 2 is the smallest prime factor of 64, and 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 64,
return six 2s.
```
